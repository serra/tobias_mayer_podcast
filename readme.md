## Release schedule

If the episode is scheduled, it gets a checkmark here.
The actual release schedule is maintained in the [Episode list on Anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episodes)

> In terms of a release schedule, it would be good to get the Introduction to Audio Edition out next, followed by Ron Jeffries' Foreword. 
> This may give useful context to those new to this content. 
> And for the third one release Catastrophic Organizational Change 
> so we have then one chapter from each section. So that's the three for this week.
>
> After that just go through the book in order, 
> selecting the next chapter from each section (3 chapters per week) 
> and obviously skipping over the ones that are already released. 
> After all chapters are done we can do the three appendices, 
> and finish on the Afterword by Lyssa.

## Technical notes

I have found an easy way to fix the volume of the audio files. I learned that this process is called "audio normalization" and there are various tools to do it. I used [a script](./normalize_audio_files.sh) to update the whole bunch in one go. The scripts require Python (3.7+) and ffmpeg to be installed. All dependencies are listed in [Pipfile](./Pipfile).

Audacity is a great tool to edit Podcasts, free, open source, and really simple to use (nice demo here on Youtube). I recommend using it if you want to make beautifully produced content. But since that's not really our goal and I don't have time to spend 10 minutes per episode on tweaking and tuning, I've turned the script instead.
